# frontend-react
A React front end

## Technology
This front-end variation for Vinces Videos will be using React

## Setup Notes
The project was set up using Node to create a react app via an `npx` command `npx create-react-app .`. This gave us a template to start from.

You can use `npm start` to run the React app.

## Deployment
The deployment will be done via an ECS container on Amazon Web Services (likely using Docker)
