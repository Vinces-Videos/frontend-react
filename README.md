# frontend-react
A React front end.

## Technology
This front-end variation for Vinces Videos will be using React.
- React
- React Router for DOM
- Material UI https://mui.com/ : This has been used to make all UI components look/feel the same without having to spend loads of time messing around with CSS
- Color Palette https://material.io/inline-tools/color/

## Setup Notes
1. The project was set up using Node to create a react app via an `npx` command `npx create-react-app .`. This gave us a template to start from.

You can use `npm start` to run the React app.

## Deployment
The deployment will be done via an ECS container on Amazon Web Services (likely using Docker).
